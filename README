GoForth
=======

I got really interested in Forth and thus I began making a parser, of sorts, in
Go. Though I don't intend for it to catch on, it's still a nifty piece of code 
and can easily be disected if you want some Forth in your code. 

Currently Supports:
	. .S 0SP + - * / DUP ?DUP 2DUP PICK TUCK NIP 
	DROP 2DROP OVER 2OVER SWAP 2SWAP 2SWAP ROT -ROT  
	( comments ) 
	
I added a "t" command that checks if the popped value is greater then the DataStack
length so that if you need to make sure that you have at least 2 numbers on the 
stack, you can call " 2 t " and it will tell you there's not enough, and then 
crash and burn, as per Go.

Enjoy!
