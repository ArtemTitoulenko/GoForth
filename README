GoForth
=======

I got really interested in Forth and thus I began making a parser, of sorts, in
Go. The initial stages are kinda silly, only being able to do basic math and 
printing, but I'll add lookup tables and functions soon enough. Though I don't 
intend for it to catch on, it's still a nifty piece of code and can easily be
disected if you want some Forth in your code. 

Enjoy!
